# TicTacToe - Project for self

Ultimate goal: make a program that will learn to play (and win!) 3x3 noughts and crosses.
1. Implement the game and random player objects,
1. Choose a learning/playing paradigm and implement a player that learns.

Current thinking is to try a rule-based playing strategy and try to learn useful rules.

##Â History
